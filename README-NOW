!=================================================================

This directory contains release candidates of
the stable Samba source branch (currently v4-11-stable).
These are not official releases and are therefore **not**
recommended for production systems.  They are provided in an
effort to obtain more widespread testing to enhance the
quality of final releases.

Please report the status of your testing to samba@samba.org.
See https://lists.samba.org/ for details on the various
mailing lists supported by Samba.org.  Thanks.

The public key for verifying the pgp signatures can 
be found one level up (../samba-pubkey.asc)
